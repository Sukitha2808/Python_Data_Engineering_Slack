Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, weighted graph. 

Here are the key steps involved:

Start with an arbitrary vertex: Choose any vertex to start the algorithm.

Repeat until all vertices are included: Continue the process until all vertices are part of the MST.

Select the minimum edge: Choose the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside of it.

Add the edge to the MST: Include the selected edge in the MST if it does not form a cycle.

Continue the process: Repeat steps 2-4 until all vertices are included in the MST
